# Miscellaneous-Algorithms
Some miscellaneous algorithm code implementations

The algorithms implemented are as follows:

# Sorting Algorithms
1. Quick Sort
2. Count Sort
3. Radix Sort
4. Merge Sort

# BIT Implementation
The code contains functions to find prefix sum and update the element.

# String Matching
Rabin Karp

# Bitmasking
N jobs N people

# Segment Tree codes
1. Find pairs i,j,k such that i<j<k and A[i]<A[j]<A[k]
2. Smaller numbers to the left
3. Find first element to the right which is greater than the current element
